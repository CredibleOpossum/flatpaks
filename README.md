# flatpaks
This is where all my flatpaks which do not fit on flathub for various reasons (quality, propritary files, wine dependency)

The prefix and and runner are about 800mb together and can't fit on github, the best results I've found is using [WineGE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom) and installing faudio using winetricks.
