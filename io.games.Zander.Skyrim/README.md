# SkyrimSE
Requires a GOG version of Skyrim or requires you to remove the DRM of a Steam or Epic version of the game (this may be illegal, consult local laws before you do this)

The prefix and and runner are about 800mb together and can't fit on github, the best results I've found is using [WineGE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom) and installing faudio using winetricks.
